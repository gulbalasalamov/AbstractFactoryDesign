## Abstract Factory Design
The inventory management app built in here intends to practise elements of reusable object oriented software states by implementing Abstract Factory Design, providing an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. Abstract Factory pattern in a sense is similar to Factory Pattern except the fact that its more like factory of factories.

## Design and Data Structures
In line with guides introduced in Head First Object Oriented Design Analysis & Design book, I aim to create tried-and-true design pattern and principles.
The structure tends to reduce duplicate codes, help objects couple loosely, and make code open for extention but closed for modification.
Do also note that some data structures may not yet totally draw from more advanved solutions introduced in newer Java versions.

## Demo App
The demo app put together a system to keep track of computer and smartphone products and helps to match customers with requested items. After initial run, some products are by default added to fill the inventory and it asks owner to add some more products by specifying their specifications. Following by you can search particular item or list of categorized items.
